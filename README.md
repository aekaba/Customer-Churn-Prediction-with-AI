# **Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Intelligence: Sustainable Customer Analytics in Subscription-Based Industries**

This project focuses on analyzing large datasets using various machine learning algorithms to derive meaningful insights from experimental results. The workflow includes data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA), model development, and performance comparison.

## **Project Objectives**
- Evaluate the efficiency of various algorithms on large-scale datasets.
- Compare model performances using datasets with and without PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
- Optimize hyperparameters to achieve the best possible results.
- Automate the recording and analysis of results for improved reproducibility.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Google Colab**: Used for rapid prototyping with the advantage of GPU/TPU acceleration.
- **Python** with the following libraries:
  - **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and PCA implementation.
  - **pandas** and **numpy**: For data processing and manipulation.
  - **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Excel Automation**: Results were recorded and analyzed using Excel reports.
